Base64 is particularly prevalent on the World Wide Web[1] where one of its uses is the ability to embed image files or other binary assets inside textual assets such as HTML and CSS files.[2] Base64 is also widely used for sending e-mail attachments. This is required because SMTP – in its original form – was designed to transport 7-bit ASCII characters only. This encoding causes an overhead of 33–37% (33% by the encoding itself; up to 4% more by the inserted line breaks)."

The scammer first sends a text to the phone number. The text claims charge was made on the credit card or bank card and wants you to confirm the purchase or some similar scary message. Some people panic and call the number and talk to someone posing as a representative."
